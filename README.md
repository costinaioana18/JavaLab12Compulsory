# JavaLab12Compulsory
I have completed the following compulsory tasks:<br>
- Creating the class MainFrame of type JFrame. The frame will contain a ControlPanel in the north and a DesignPanel in the center.
- The ControlPanel will allow the user to specify any class name of a Swing component (such as JButton, JLabel, JButton, JSpinner), a text for that component's name and a button for creating and adding an instance of the specified component to the DesignPanel.
- The DesignPanel represents a simple JPanel, and containing Swing components added by our user.

**See the functionality.mkv video/ functionality2.jpg picture to see how the components are added to the design panel**
